`simMetric` is an R package that provides metrics (and their Monte Carlo standard errors) for the assessment of statistical methods in simulation studies.  This package includes metrics that are calculated as per this [tutorial](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8086) published by Tim Morris, Ian White and Michael Crowther. For an in-depth description on the calculation and interpretation, and how to perform a simulation study in general, refer to this [tutorial](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8086).
